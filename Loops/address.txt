My fellow citizens,

Let the word go forth from this time and place,
That the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans—
Born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by peace.

We stand today on the edge of a new frontier,
Not because it is easy, but because it is right.

Let every nation know, whether friend or foe,
That we shall pay any price, bear any burden,
Meet any hardship, support any friend,
To assure the survival and success of liberty.

United, there is little we cannot do.
Divided, there is little we can accomplish.

To those people in the huts and villages across the globe,
We pledge our best efforts to help them help themselves.

To our adversaries, we offer not a clenched fist but an open hand,
If they are willing to unclench theirs.

Let both sides explore what problems unite us,
Instead of belaboring those problems which divide us.

Let both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science,
Instead of its terrors.

Let both sides unite to heed in all corners of the earth
The command of Isaiah—to “undo the heavy burdens... and let the oppressed go free.”

And so, my fellow Americans:
Ask not what your country can do for you—
Ask what you can do for your country.

Let us go forth to lead the land we love,
With faith in the future and devotion to freedom.

Thank you, and may God bless you all.
